            <p>
                A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee (of various types, e.g. espresso, latte, cappuccino).
                 Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks such as iced coffee and iced tea; in continental Europe, cafés serve alcoholic drinks.
                  A coffeehouse may also serve food such as light snacks, sandwiches, muffins or pastries. Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small 
                  businesses to large multinational corporations. 
                  Some coffeehouse chains operate on a franchise business model, with numerous branches across various countries around the world.
                <br><br>
                While café may refer to a coffeehouse, the term "café" generally refers to a diner, British café (colloquially called a "caff"), 
                "greasy spoon" (a small and inexpensive restaurant), transport café, teahouse or tea room, or other casual eating and drinking place.
            A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria. 
            Many coffeehouses in the Middle East and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world offer shisha (actually called nargile in Levantine Arabic, 
            Greek and Turkish), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah. 
            An espresso bar is a type of coffeehouse that specializes in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks.
